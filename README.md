Description (outdated)
===========
This cookbook installs (currently only) the host machine with OpenVZ packages.

Additionally, it adds a watchdog script, which alerts `root`, if VEs exceed their limits.

Note that this can only work on Debian Squeeze, as OpenVZ-Support has been removed with Wheezy :-(
